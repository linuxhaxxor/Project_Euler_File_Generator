# Project_Euler_File_Generator
A simple python script to generate a working directory for all Project Euler Problems using a webscraper (bs4) and python 3. Run the python script (without a VPN) and you'll have a working directory to start all Project Euler Problems. (Work in progress. Others must join me in making it even better and suggesting better processes)
